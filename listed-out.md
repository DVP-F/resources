### **Difficulty Guide**  

- **1-2:** Foundation skills (ideally learned in weeks-months).  
- **3-4:** Requires technical practice/research (months-years).  
- **5:** Mastery level – demands years of dedicated work and deep study.

### **Implementation Tips**  

1. Start with **Tier 1 goals**, 1-2 skills at a time.  
2. For **high-difficulty 5 goals**, prioritize research (whitepapers/CVE analysis).  
3. Use **projects** to bridge skills (e.g., *AFM analysis* → *AI penetration tool*).
